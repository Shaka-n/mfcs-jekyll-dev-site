        <h2> Your Safety is Our #1 Concern</h2>
        <p>Our office is operating both at the 409 Fortune Blvd, Milford, MA address for face to face therapy and
            remotely over video screening or telephone, for those who would rather not come into the office. Our
            therapists have received their vaccinations and our office is adhering to the CDC guidelines; requiring mask
            wearing, 6 feet distancing, installed automatic sanitizers in the waiting rooms and staggering scheduling,
            allowing reduced waiting room traffic. Please call our office if you would like to schedule a session with a
            therapist at our office or schedule a remote meeting with a therapist through video or telephone call.</p>
