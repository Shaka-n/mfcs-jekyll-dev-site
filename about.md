#About Us

Milford-Franklin Counseling Services, Inc. was established by Sandy Greenwald, LICSW in 1986. Since then the professional staff has grown to approximately 30 experienced, highly qualified therapists.

In a comfortable and supportive setting, the therapists provide the tools for making better decisions, resolving problems and improving relationships. MFCS therapists have experience in a wide variety of specialties, enhancing their ability to meet the needs of clients in every age group.

#Our Mission

Our primary responsibility to clients is the establishment and maintenance of a safe place, an environment of comfort and trust, where clients may freely explore any area of their thoughts, emotions or behavior, assured of confidentiality, and without fear of judgment or repercussion.
